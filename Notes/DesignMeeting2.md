Design Overview
----------------
We met with the San Diego Zoo and checked out the various sites that we will install the enclosure and mechanisms. After looking at each site we found that each deployment will have to vary depending of the site due to the different conditions of each. The following is a list of each site with accompnaying phot descriptions:

* Condor
  - On the first site (Condor) we found out that there are multiple panels, rather than just one, that we have to monitor for bird collision. This means that we have to reassess if we should use a single enclosure for each panel or if we should have our sensors across several panels with a single camera pointing to them. We will also have to find a way to power our system since the location is not ideal for solar collection. By dividing up the power system, camera, and sensor array we can effectively cover the site using only 3 systems. There are 8 panels that are approximately 10-11 feet high and 5-6 feet wide.

* Rattle Snake

* Turtle area
  - Unlike the other exhibits, this exhibit's window panes are short in height and long in width; each pane is around 4' high and 9' wide. The main area of interest is only a couple panes wide and is a high traffic area for zoo visitors. Therefore, the system we put in place must be out of reach from adults and children observing the exhibit. Ideally, the system would also be out of sight from visitors, although there are limited areas to place the system. Any cables that run from the main controller to the sensors on the window panes can run along the inside of the panes inside the exhibit as long as they are inconspicuous and immune to a bite from a turtle. There are very few places to put the main controller, so more observations in the area are needed before a design can be developed. 

* Crocodiles 
  - Exhibit observation area is a gazebo-like enclosing with multiple window panes to observe the crocodiles. There are four pillars holding up the roof, one of which is exposed to sunlight and is in the perfect location to observe the window panes. Only a fraction of the pillar is left uncovered; a small rectangular area on the top of the pillar is open, which includes the corner of the pillar closest to the window panes. Therefore, the design of the monitoring unit may need to be custom-built to fit the open area of the pillar so that it is not conspicuous and does not look unnatural in its position.

* SEA 

* Orangutan
  - This exhibit area has high window panes that extend from the ground up to the enclosure ceiling. There are no railings or immediate protection of the glass that separates guests from the window panes. There are a lot of trees and shrubbery inside the exhibit which may mean that this is a high collision site as birds tend to fly along the level of vegetation. Thus, in order to mitigate the number of collisions, zoo keepers have placed bird decals on the window panes to indicate the presence of the glass. This site is feasible and the number of trees along the enclosure may allow us to mount and camoflage our system so that it would not be plainly visible to guests yet enable the cameras a full view of the window panes
