Design Overview
----------------
We met with the San Diego Zoo and checked out the various sites that we will install the enclosure and mechanisms. After looking at each site we found that each deployment will have to vary depending of the site due to the different conditions of each. The following is a list of each site with accompnaying phot descriptions:

* Condor

* Rattle Snake

* Turtle area

* Crocodiles 

* SEA 

* Orangutan
