Design Overview
----------------
We met with the San Diego Zoo and checked out the various sites that we will install the enclosure and mechanisms. After looking at each site we found that each deployment will have to vary depending of the site due to the different conditions of each. The following is a list of each site with accompnaying phot descriptions:

* Condor

* Rattle Snake

* Turtle area
  - Unlike the other exhibits, this exhibit's window panes are short in height and long in width; each pane is around 4' high and 9' wide. The main area of interest is only a couple panes wide and is a high traffic area for zoo visitors. Therefore, the system we put in place must be out of reach from adults and children observing the exhibit. Ideally, the system would also be out of sight from visitors, although there are limited areas to place the system. Any cables that run from the main controller to the sensors on the window panes can run along the inside of the panes inside the exhibit as long as they are inconspicuous and immune to a bite from a turtle. There are very few places to put the main controller, so more observations in the area are needed before a design can be developed. 

* Crocodiles 
  - Exhibit observation area is a gazebo-like enclosing with multiple window panes to observe the crocodiles. There are four pillars holding up the roof, one of which is exposed to sunlight and is in the perfect location to observe the window panes. Only a fraction of the pillar is left uncovered; a small rectangular area on the top of the pillar is open, which includes the corner of the pillar closest to the window panes. Therefore, the design of the monitoring unit may need to be custom-built to fit the open area of the pillar so that it is not conspicuous and does not look unnatural in its position.

* SEA 

* Orangutan
