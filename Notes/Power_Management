Power Management Notes

- mBed microcontroller has an RTC built in, but obviously needs an exteranl 3V battery for constant power supply
  - Possible solutions: - configure RTC before installation to have current time on it, power it up with the solar power, and keep it powered up permanently
                        - just use a sequential timer in order to turn the system on/off after a certain number of hours 
                        - supply the RTC on the mBed with an external 3V battery that will last ~2 years
- single NPN gate can turn system on and off with the use of digital I/O pins on mBed
