RUN:

   Need to run main with permissions (BlackLib libraries and SDCard storage
   requires root user permissions). 
       $: sudo ./main 
   
   TODO:
        - Create a cron job script to run main at specified time intervals 
          (@boot ?)


STORAGE:

    In order to store videos on external SD Card, need to mount card on 
    insertion first. Likewise, in order to remove, need to unmout card. 
    SD card storage registers as device: mmcblk1p1
        Mount:
           $: sudo mount /dev/mmcblk1p1/ /home/ubuntu/AngryBirds/SDCard/ -t auto
        Unmount:
           $: sudo umount /dev/mmcblk1p1/  

   TODO: 
        - revise /etc/init.d/ (or /etc/rc.local) to mount automatically on boot
        - figure out a way to unmount card w/o terminal command (easy removal
          for zoo clients) - maybe via IR remote ??
